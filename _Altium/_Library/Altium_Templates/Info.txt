Altium Templates ( PcbDoc) help to check your layout against the Eurocircuits technology classification ( 6C and 8D). 
This way you can easily define which Eurocircuits service is most suited for you board, and avoid documentation problems after you place your order.



There are also 2 scripts available to check the annular ring of your design
The “FindAnnularRing_XX.pas” script is capable to check the annular ring for OAR and
IAR on the appropriate values for PTH (PHD is finished hole size + 100µm).

    FindAnnularRing_6C.pas:Altium Designer Rule script for checking onPattern Class 6C,
    FindAnnularRing_8D.pas:Altium Designer Rule script for checking onPattern Class 8D,

How to use this package:

    Select the required Pattern / Drill class (6C of 8D) and number of layers.
    Put a copy of the PcbDoc in your Altium Designer project folder (*.PcbPrj).
    Put a copy of the script (6C or 8D) in your project folder.

From this moment the EuroCircuits rules for Pattern Class, Drill Class and layer-stack is available in the design.
Remarks:

    The minimum annular ring rule “Minimum-IAR” is set to the IAR value of the Pattern class. This value is larger than the OAR. When “Top-Middle-Bottom” or “Full stack” is used it is possible to change the OAR to the (smaller) values of the Pattern Class.
    Altium Designer checks the minimal annular ring value when “Top-Middle-Bottom” or “Full stack” is used the OAR can be set smaller than the IAR. The“FindAnnularRing_XX.pas” script is capable to check the annular ring for OAR and IAR on the appropriate values for PTH (PHD is finished hole size + 100µm).
